Business accounts have the ability to divide apps into groups and assign specific team members to each group.

## Create a New Group
To create a new Group, switch to the context of your team's account and go to your team admin.

Select the "App Groups" section and click "Create a Group". Provide a name for the group, then assign apps and users to the group.

_**Note:** An app can only belong to one group, but users can belong to many groups._

Once apps and users are assigned, click "Save Groups". That's it! Apps assigned to a group can only be accessed by the users assigned to the group.

### User Permissions
[User permissions](/teams/roles-permissions) within the context of the group are inherited from those given to the user when they were added to the team.
